## Instructions for Shiny-App Usage

The App includes a prediction model for fertility based on swiss socio-economic indicators from end of XIX.
The prediction algorithm is based on the "swiss" dataset, which includes observations for each of 47 French-speaking provinces in Switzerland. 
The model has been estimated using the lm method and has two regressors: Agriculture and Education.
Agriculture represents the percentage of males involved in agriculture as occupation while Education represents the percentage of draftees with education beyond primary school. 

The prediction algorithm is embebbed in the App and so the User only needs to choose the values of Agriculture and Education for which he wishes to obtain a fertility prediction. The user can choose the desired values interactivily through the respective sidebars in the "Prediction" Tab. The default values are 11% for the variable education and 50% for the variable agriculture. The default values correspond to the means over the 47 observations.

Once the User has chosen values for the variables Agriculture and Education other than the default and has submitted them, the predicted value for fertility is displayed as a red dot in the figure. The graphic is a scatterplot for the fertility (y-axis), education (x-axis) and agriculture (included through colour) data from the swiss dataset. It also includes a smooth-line for the model fit.
